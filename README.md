Pardon My English is designed to assist non-native English speakers by transforming semantically incorrect or awkwardly phrased English text into grammatically accurate and fluent English. Users simply input their original text, and the bot efficiently processes and returns a polished version, enhancing clarity and coherence. Ideal for learners of English, professionals, and anyone looking to improve their written communication.
