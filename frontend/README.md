# Pardon My English Streamlit App

https://pardonmyenglish.streamlit.app

If you want to run the app locally, start by copying the template file into your home directory:

```shell
cp secrets.toml.template ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

You'll need to obtain a Groq API key, which you'll then provide in the "secrets.toml" file as a `GROQ_API_KEY`.
